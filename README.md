# Webkit Audio Grid

## Overview
"Webkit Audio Grid" a simple drag-n-drop audio grid created for Chrome. I didn't benefit from any fancy frameworks (such as React) because managing state wasn't especially difficult for this project, but to be fair, I used [jsmediatags](https://github.com/aadsm/jsmediatags) to parse metadata and facebook's [rebound](https://github.com/facebook/rebound-js) reliably animate.

### Want to use it?
- First, clone the repo (`git clone http://github.com/samolaogun/webkit-audio-grid.git`)
- Next install all of the dependencies (`npm i`)
- Then, build the project (`npm build`)
- Lastly, start the web server (`npm start`).

Great! Now on you can play local music in the browser on port `8080`.
